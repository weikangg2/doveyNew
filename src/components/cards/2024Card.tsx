                    want any more extra decorations on the table, so i decided to make wut babi likes 
                    to ply like puzzle n some other games but couldnt make solitaire cus too hard ig 
                    hahahaha, and also made somewhat like a photo gallery with our current highlights, 
                    which can auto play itself too :D hope babi likes dis smol gifty i prepared which
